# SabrinaHuajy-CodeQuiz
A timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

As a front-end coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores hence I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

Given I am taking a code quiz, when I click the "Start Quiz" button, then a timer starts and I am presented with the first question.

The questions contain buttons for each answer, when I have clicked the answer and answered the question, then I am presented with another question. 

When I answer a question incorrectly and clicked the incorrect answer, then time is subtracted from the clock. 

The correct or wrong feedback would appear together with their corresponding beeping sounds.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the quiz should end and the game is over.

When the game is over, it should display the score and give me, the user the ability to save my initials and score.

The scores and initials would be stored locally and the user would be redirected to a highscore leaderboard which would present the scores and user initials in descending order. The user would be able to clear the scores on the leaderboard if they wish.
