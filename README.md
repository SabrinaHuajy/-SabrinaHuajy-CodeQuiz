# SabrinaHuajy-CodeQuiz
A timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

As a front-end coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores hence I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

Given I am taking a code quiz, when I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with the first question.

The questions contain buttons for each answer, when I have clicked the answer and answered the question, then I am presented with another question. 
When I answer a question incorrectly and clicked the incorrect answer, then time is subtracted from the clock. 

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the quiz should end and the game is over.

When the game is over, it should display the score and give me, the user the ability to save my initials and score.

Hereby I present this timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
